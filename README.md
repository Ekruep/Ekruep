👋 Hi, I’m @Ekruep
👀 I’m interested in developing software that adds real value to peoples' lives and business, particularly in healthcare, technology, and spirituality.
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Angular, and Ionic.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other developers that can help accelerate the process from vision to reality.
📫 People can reach me here at github or at my primary email address at ejkruep at gmail dot com.
